    In the modern world, it is impossible to do without IT. I'm more interested in creating something, namely frontend development. After learning about The Rolling Scopes, I immediately started preparing for stage 1, since I didn't find stage 0. I have a great desire to learn a new business, although I am a technician by education with no experience in programming. Positive qualities: the desire to learn, to know the world, to delve into science... 
> "Development and humanism" is my motto.
